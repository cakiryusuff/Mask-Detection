# Mask Detection With Haarcascades


<div align="center">
<p>
<img src="GitProject/sources/masked.PNG" width=400 height=500/>
<img src="GitProject/sources/nomask.PNG" width=400 height=500/>
</p>

</div>

  The logic is simple. I used 2 haarcascade. First one for face, other one for mouth. If there is a face and there is not mouth then masked. If there is a face and mouth then unmasked.
